# 🧠 MBSE Showcase: Brake System Architecture Design

**📌 Skill Area:**  
Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) using SysML & IBM Rhapsody

---

## 📋 Summary  
As part of the Brake System team at Bosch, I used the SPES methodology to model and analyze a complex brake product function through multiple stakeholder perspectives. This effort was aimed at enhancing system clarity, enabling requirement traceability, and reducing design ambiguity across teams.

## 🔧 Key Activities

- 📑 Developed structured system requirements using **IBM DOORS**
- 🧩 Modeled the system using **IBM Rational Rhapsody**  
- 🔍 Created and maintained **Requirement**,**Functional**, **Logical**, and **Technical** Viewpoints following SPES (Software Platform Embedded Systems) guidelines  
- 🧭 Used **SysML diagrams** (Use Case, Block Definition, Internal Block, Activity) to support stakeholder-specific visualizations

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- **IBM Rational Rhapsody** – for model authoring  
- **SysML** – for system modeling and viewpoints  
- **SPES Methodology** – for structured abstraction and layering  
- **IBM DOORS** – for requirement linking and traceability

## 🧠 Value Delivered

- ✅ Enhanced system design clarity and reduced rework by over 75%  
- 🔗 Achieved end-to-end requirement traceability across all architectural levels  
- 📈 Streamlined cross-functional understanding of complex brake system behavior  
- 🧩 Enabled decomposition of large system blocks into analyzable and testable components

## 💡 Reflection

This MBSE initiative deepened my ability to break down abstract system goals into tangible, testable components. It also strengthened my ability to visually communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders through structured viewpoints.
