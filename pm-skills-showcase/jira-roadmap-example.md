# PM Skills Showcase: JIRA Roadmap and Sprint Planning

**Context:**  
While leading development efforts for regenerative braking systems at Bosch, I actively contributed to sprint planning and backlog grooming using JIRA.

**Key Activities:**
- Created and managed product backlogs for system features.
- Defined sprint goals and user stories based on stakeholder input.
- Tracked progress and priorities using Kanban views and dashboards.

**Tools Used:**
- JIRA for backlog management and sprint planning
- IBM DOORS for requirements traceability

**Impact:**
- Ensured timely and transparent communication with development teams and stakeholders.
- Improved sprint velocity by 15% through clearly defined stories and acceptance criteria.
- Helped align sprint cycles with roadmap milestones and release planning.

**Reflection:**  
Using JIRA not only improved team collaboration but also gave me deep insights into how agile product teams balance scope, velocity, and stakeholder value.
